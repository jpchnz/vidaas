#summary Update ViDaas webpages

= Introduction =

This are instructions for developers who would like to use a VM to do some development work (e.g update webpages, test a certain version/patch, etc.)

== Setup ==

 * Create the image a usual
 * Create a user for developer
 * Update permissions
   * Add this user to the vidaas group
   * chmod 775 $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/
   * chmod g+w $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/vidaas
 * Install sudo if jboss restart required

add this to your /etc/sudoers , add users to VIDAAS_DEV 
{{{
User_Alias      VIDAAS_DEV = vidaas
Cmnd_Alias      JBOSS51 = /etc/init.d/jboss51
VIDAAS_DEV      ALL = NOPASSWD: JBOSS51
}}}

= Editing Files =

== Using google code ==

Use the editor provided by google code by following this URL
[https://code.google.com/p/vidaas/source/browse/#svn%2Fvidaas3%2Ftrunk%2Fvidaas%2FWebContent Googlecode-repository]

== Using subversion on any computer of your choice ==

Get your username password from [https://code.google.com/p/vidaas/source/checkout here]

Initial checkout to your own machine:
{{{
svn co https://vidaas.googlecode.com/svn/vidaas3/trunk/
}}}

To update go into the same directory and run:
{{{
svn up
}}}

To save your changes:
{{{
svn commit
}}}

== Use subversion on the server / VM ==

Do exactly as in described under the heading above

To build the .war file do the following
{{{
cd ~/trunk/vidaas/
mvn package
}}}

To clean the build environment (this forces a full rebuild when running mvn package)
{{{
cd ~/trunk/vidaas/
mvn clean
}}}

to deploy
{{{
cd ~/trunk/vidaas
cp -r target/vidaas-0.3/ /opt/jboss/server/default/deploy/
}}}

to undeploy 
{{{
rm -rf /opt/jboss/server/default/deploy/vidaas-0.3/
}}}

== To edit files directly ==

You have to deploy the webapp first as described above, then

{{{
cd /opt/jboss/server/default/deploy/vidaas-0.3/
}}}
where you can edit files directly.

for example if you change theme.css
{{{
vi /opt/jboss/server/default/deploy/vidaas-0.3/stylesheet/theme.css
}}}

copy it back into the repository using
{{{
cp /opt/jboss/server/default/deploy/vidaas-0.3/stylesheet/theme.css ~/trunk/vidaas/WebContent/stylesheet/theme.css
}}}

check the changes, and make sure there are no other changes then your own
{{{
cd ~/trunk/vidaas
svn diff
}}}

and if you see the expected change you can commit it to the repository using
{{{
svn commit
}}}

== Restart jboss ==

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/jboss51 stop
tail -F /opt/jboss/server/default/log/server.log   #wait till shutdown complete then press Ctrl-C
sudo /etc/init.d/jboss51 start
#you can use the same command as above to look at the log file to see check server startup has completed
}}}

== If you get error pages ==

 * Please report the error via email or the issue tracker
 * After the problem is fixed go to your working copy (your computer, server, ..)
   * run svn up and mvn package as describe above
   * redeploy the app to the server as described above
