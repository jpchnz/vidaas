This component implements the web front-end end database management functionality. It is a Java webapp using the JBoss Seam framework (http://seamframework.org/). It was original developed as part of the sudamih project (http://sudamih.oucs.ox.ac.uk/).

It manages the individual projects and stores it's configuration, metadata, etc in a locally installed MySQL database.

When a user requests to create a DataInterface (a web-frontent to access a project database) uses seam-gen to dynamically generate a new webapp and deploys it to the application server.
