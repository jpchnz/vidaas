= Migration from VIDaaS to ORDS =

The purpose of this document is to give rough estimate to migrate existing VIDaaS application running on JBoss 5.1 to ORDS running on JBoss 7.1. The migration to the latest server is not straight forward exercise due to recent changes in various underlying technologies. 


= Details of Existing Technologies Used =

Following are different frameworks and technologies used for VIDaaS
  * JBoss 5.1 (release date: 23-05-2009)
  * JBoss Seam 2.2 (release date: 27.04.2011)
  * RichFaces 3.3.3.Final (release date: 06-04-2010)
  * Java Server Faces 1.2 (release date: 01-03-2011)

Oracle released major update of their Java Enterprise Editions 6 specifications in December 2009. These were specifications and open source community and other vendors were supposed to implement these specifications. Major implementations of JEE 6 specifications by various open source communities and vendors were only available from mid 2011. JBoss 7.0 is compliant to JEE 6 specifications and was released on 17-08-2011.

Due to major changes in JEE 6, frameworks and technologies used in VIDaaS applications are not compatible with the latest specifications. The migration of VIDaaS from JBoss 5.1 to JBoss 7.x requires update of underlying frameworks and technologies which itself results in major re-engineering of the whole application. 

= Preview of the VIDaaS =

VIDaaS application is composed of three tiers:
  * Web tier i.e. Web Interface available from browser
  * Business tier i.e. application specific logic
  * Backend tier i.e. database management, data interface creation, database conversion etc.

= Migration Requirements =

The latest version of JBoss 7.x is not compatible with Seam 2.2 and VIDaaS in the current form is not deployable to JBoss 7.x. The latest implementation of Seam compatible to JEE 6 is called Weld (formerly known as Seam 3.0). Weld is also the reference implementation of new specification Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI).
Similarly, JBoss 7.x is more aligned with latest specification of Java Server Faces 2.0 and internally uses different implementation from JBoss 5.1.
Meanwhile RichFaces also had a major release 4.x, compatible with Java Server Faces 2.0 and JEE 6.

The migration of VIDaaS will requires update of all those frameworks, configuring of new components and testing. The major advantage of Seam 2.2 was an umbrella framework wrapping various implementations as one-stop-solution. In the migration each tool will require manual integration and testing which can lead to potential integration issues.

* Web tier extensively uses tag libraries (utility html tags) i.e. <s:validateAll>, <s:link>, <s:button>, etc. These utility tags are not available in the latest implementation Weld and one has to find out other open source implementations providing the similar functionality. The ajaxification of Web tier is via RichFaces 3.3.3.Final which provides lot of out of box tags, widgets and gadgets. These tags are the major part of user interface but unfortunately they were not compatible with Java Server Faces 2.0 and those tags are not available in the latest release of RichFaces 4.x or their use is changed significantly.

Web Tier upgrade to JSF 2.0 best case scenario 2-3 weeks (replacement tag libraries available and integrated smoothly). Worse case scenario 5 weeks if the above mentioned libraries needs in-house implementation or integration is not smooth enough. Both cases will require learning, research and experimentation.
