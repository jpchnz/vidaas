= Introduction =

Once PostgreSQL has been installed there is a small amount of configuration that will need to be done. *Note* while the following discussion will get the job done and allow VIDaaS to work with PostgreSQL, it is by no means a complete instruction set. PostfgreSQL should actually be configured in accordance with site security policies.


= Details =

If the version of PostgreSQL is <x> then the following file needs to be edited

{{{
/etc/postgresql/<x>/main/pg_hba.conf
}}}

This file deals with how clients are able to connect with the PostgreSQL server. Seek out the IPv4 host line and alter this
from
{{{
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
}}}
to
{{{
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust
}}}

This will set all TCP requests to the PostgreSQL server to be allowed unconditionally.
