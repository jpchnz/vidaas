<ul class="bullets">
	<li><span>jQuery</span> SQL Designer can be accessed at the
	following URL: <a
		href="http://daas.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/jQuerySQLDesigner/designer.seam">http://daas.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/jQuerySQLDesigner/designer.seam</a></li>

	<li><span>jQuery</span> SQL Designer is online tool for database
	designing. It can be used for designing new database, modifying
	existing database or viewing the design of live database.</li>

	<li>jQuery SQL Designer is intentionally made "Double Click". This
	means for each action double click is required. It will be made clear
	in the remaining instructions.</li>

	<li><img border='0' width='61' height='60'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image002.jpg" /> is the Table icon. To start
	the database designing, drag "Table" icon. This will bring the pop-up
	suggesting to first create database itself, as shown: <br></br>
	<img border='0' width='212' height='232'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image004.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Fill the form accordingly by giving the name of database and
	its description and click button "Create Database". This will result in
	another pop-up confirming the successful creation of database.</li>

	<li>Drag the "Table" icon again on the grid to create the table.
	Create Table pop-up will appear. Please fill the form as required and
	click the button "Create Table". <br></br>
	<img border='0' width='244' height='267'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image008.jpg" /></li>

	<li>This will result in the creation of new table with one primary
	key "ID" as integer. In next versions of the database it will be
	possible to create a database without any primary key. <img border='0'
		width='173' height='59' src="SQLDesigner_files/image010.jpg" /></li>

	<li><img border='0' width='52' height='46'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image012.jpg" /> is the Column icon. It is
	used to add columns to existing tables.</li>

	<li>Drag "Column" icon on already created table. This will bring
	the Create Column pop-up as shown below: <br></br>
	<img border='0' width='242' height='388'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image014.jpg" /></li>

	<li>There are few things to notice. Fields "Data Length" and
	"Scale" are either disabled or enabled depending on the Column Type.
	For data type "char" and "vchar" the field "Data Length" is editable. <br></br>
	<img border='0' width='337' height='142'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image016.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Similarly for the data type "Decimal" and "Float", fields
	"Data Length" and "Scale" are editable. <br />
	<img border='0' width='310' height='131'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image018.jpg" /></li>

	<li>If the field is tagged as Primary Key then the form
	automatically selects the column properties as "Not Null" and "Unique"
	and made them un-editable. <br />
	<img border='0' width='376' height='120'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image020.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Fill the Create Column form as required and click on the button
	"Create Column". This will add a new column to the existing table. <br />
	<img border='0' width='167' height='81'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image022.jpg" /></li>

	<li><img border='0' width='22' height='35'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image024.jpg" /> is the properties icon on the
	right hand side of Table and Column names. Double clicking on the
	properties icon brings either Modify Table or Modify Column form. User
	can verify, modify and update the existing values for the table and
	columns. The form do also has options to Delete Table or Delete Column
	buttons.</li>

	<li><img border='0' width='30' height='35'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image026.jpg" /> is the minimise icon on the
	left hand side of the table name. Double click the minimise icon to
	minimise the table. The table will be minimised and its header will
	change the background colour and font size as shown below: <br />
	<img border='0' width='160' height='48'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image028.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Tables can be dragged around the design panel by bringing the
	mouse on table header. Mouse icon changes on entering the table header
	and changes again when user right click the mouse button.</li>

	<li>There are various icons for various types of relations i.e.
	One-To-One (Identifying and Non Identifying), One-To-Many One
	(Identifying and Non Identifying) and Many-To-Many.</li>

	<li>When any of the relation button is clicked it changes its
	appearance as shown below: <br />
	<img border='0' width='48' height='44'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image030.jpg" /> ..... to ...... <img
		border='0' width='48' height='44' src="SQLDesigner_files/image032.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Icons with dashed lines represent Non Identifying relations.
	Similarly icons with continuous line represent Identifying relations.</li>

	<li>Drawing relations between two tables involves three steps:</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Click the appropriate relation icon</li>
		<li>Double click the header of Table with Primary Key</li>
		<li>Double click the header of secondary (dependent) Table.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Line will be drawn between two tables representing the
	relation and the relation icon reverts to its normal state. <br />
	<img border='0' width='459' height='109'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image034.jpg" /></li>

	<li>Moving the cursor on the relation will change the colour of
	the relation and also highlights headers of tables involved.</li>

	<li><img border='0' width='55' height='56'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image036.jpg" /> is SQL Generator option and
	it produces the SQL for the designed database.</li>
	<li><img border='0' width='44' height='51'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image038.jpg" /> button loads one existing
	database. This option is to kick start the process of familiarising
	with jQuerySQL Designer. It is quite complicated database used by Roman
	Economy Project in Oxford University.</li>

	<li>The button "Load Live Database" is a new very powerful feature
	to draw Design Diagram from the live running database.</li>

	<li>Click on the "Load Live Database", it will bring the pop-up
	where enters the appropriate fields. The pop-up form is shown below: <br />
	<img border='0' width='276' height='341'
		src="SQLDesigner_files/image040.jpg" /></li>

	<li>We support all major Databases but right now we are only
	functionality related to MySQL and PostgreSQL is available from GUI.</li>

	<li>Select the database type; enter the host name where database
	is located without any protocol i.e. daas.oucs.ox.ac.uk. The following
	URL http:// daas.oucs.ox.ac.uk will not work.</li>

	<li>Enter the database port for MySQL the default port is 3306 and
	for PostgreSQL it is 5432 but contact your system administrator if you
	are not sure.</li>

	<li>In the end enter the user name and password of the user who
	has access to the database.</li>
	<li>SQL Designer supports the migrating of database from one
	vendor to another at run time. It follows following steps:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Pulls the database design from existing database.</li>
		<li>Pulls the data from the existing database.</li>
		<li>Create new database which can even be on different database
		platform</li>
		<li>Populate the database with the data.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
