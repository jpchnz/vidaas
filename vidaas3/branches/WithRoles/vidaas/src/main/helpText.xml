			<helpId>DatabaseCreationPopup_DatabaseName</helpId>

			<helpId>DatabaseCreationPopup_DatabaseDescription</helpId>
			<title>Database description</title>
			<text>This field should be used to describe the content and scope of
				the database, to record who created or compiled the data (and for
				what purpose), to state when the data was collected or digitized,
				and to supply any other information that may be needed to permit
				proper interpretation of the data at a later date, such as whether
				the data has been edited or manipulated since collection.

			<helpId>DatabaseCreationPopup_EstimatedSize</helpId>
			<title>Estimated database size</title>
			<text>This defines the total space that will be available to your
				project for hosting databases. Please be aware that if you intend to
				create more than one version of any given database within your
				project (i.e. a separate test copy or ‘milestone’ copy), this will
				create a duplicate of that database, thus increasing your total
				space usage. The 25 GB option should be ample for research databases
				that do not contain more than 100,000 records and do not include
				images, audio files, or other multimedia, even if you make two
				duplicates. If you are intending to build a database larger than
				this, or which contains multimedia, you may wish to consider the 100
				GB option. If you exceed your allotted space you will be asked if
				you would like to switch to a larger allowance, but this will entail
				moving to a different pricing plan. The ORDS is not designed to cope
				with very large databases although if you think you might require
				more than 100 GB we may be able to create a customized virtual
				machine that will suit your requirement. Please email us if that is
				the case.
